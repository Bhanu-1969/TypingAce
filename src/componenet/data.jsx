        "text": "Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31."

Rahul Kumar, 17, clambered over the enclosure fence at the  Kamla Nehru Zoological Park in Ahmedabad, and began running towards the animals, shouting he would 'kill them'. Mr Kumar explained afterwards that he was drunk and 'thought I'd stand a good chance' against the predators. Next level drunk: Intoxicated Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into the lions' enclosure at a zoo in Ahmedabad and began running towards the animals shouting 'Today I kill a lion!' Mr Kumar had been sitting near the enclosure when he suddenly made a dash for the lions, surprising zoo security. The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.' Brave fool: Fortunately, Mr Kumar  fell into a moat as he ran towards the lions and could be rescued by zoo security staff before reaching the animals (stock image) Kumar later explained: 'I don't really know why I did it. 'I was drunk and thought I'd stand a good chance.' A police spokesman said: 'He has been cautioned and will be sent for psychiatric evaluation. 'Fortunately for him, the lions were asleep and the zoo guards acted quickly enough to prevent a tragedy similar to that in Delhi.' Last year a 20-year-old man was mauled to death by a tiger in the Indian capital after climbing into its enclosure at the city zoo."

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons."

The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates."

The prize porker, known  as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool. A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'At 4.50pm yesterday the service received a call to a pig stuck in a swimming pool. 'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex . The exhausted animal had to be winched to using an all-terrain crane but appeared no worse for wear after its tumble . 'The crew rescued the pig from the swimming pool using specialist animal rescue slide boards, strops and lines to haul the pig from the swimming pool.' But Pigwig wasn't the only animal who needed rescuing after taking an unexpected swim . Crews in West Sussex were called out to a swimming pool where this time a horse had fallen in. Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land. A fire brigade spokesman said that she appeared none the worse for her impromptu swim after stepping over the edge of the domestic pool."

        "text": "The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation\u2019s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust\u2019s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. \u2018He noted\u2026that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,\u2019 the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: \u2018The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. \u2018But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people \u2018tune in\u2019 in new, digital ways. \u2018[Those ways] aren\u2019t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here \u2013 like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.\u2019 BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today\u2019s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. \u2018He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,\u2019 the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC\u2019s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new \u2018digital first\u2019 strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to \u2018learn lessons\u2019 if they want to \u2018compete with organisations that were born in the digital age\u2019."

        "text": "(CNN)So, you'd like a \"Full House\" reunion and spinoff? You got it, dude! Co-star John Stamos announced Monday night on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" that Netflix has ordered up a reunion special, followed by a spinoff series called \"Fuller House.\" The show will feature Candace Cameron Bure, who played eldest daughter D.J. Tanner in the original series -- which aired from 1987 to 1995 -- as the recently widowed mother of three boys. \"It's sort of a role reversal, and we turn the house over to her,\" Stamos told Kimmel. Jodie Sweetin, who played Stephanie Tanner in the original series, and Andrea Barber, who portrayed D.J.'s best friend Kimmy Gibbler, will both return for the new series, Netflix said. Stamos will produce and guest star. Talks with co-starsBob Saget, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin are ongoing, Netflix said. The show will be available next year, Netflix said. \"As big fans of the original Full House, we are thrilled to be able to introduce Fuller House's new narrative to existing fans worldwide, who grew up on the original, as well as a new generation of global viewers that have grown up with the Tanners in syndication,\"  Netflix Vice President of Original Content Cindy Holland said in a statement. The show starts with Tanner -- now named Tanner-Fuller (get it ... Fuller?) -- pregnant, recently widowed and living in San Francisco. Her younger sister Stephanie -- now an aspiring musician -- and her lifelong best friend and fellow single mom, Kimmy, move in to help her care for her two boys and the new baby. On Monday, Barber tweeted Cameron Bure to ask whether she was ready to resume their onscreen friendship. \"We never stopped,\" Cameron Bure tweeted back. Fans were over the moon at the news."

        "text": "At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just   3400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame \u2013 and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do."

        "text": "A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family \u2013 it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people \"slags\" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively. Zsolt Szalontai, 18, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of rape. He was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute."

Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos . Nervous: Tunisian boat captain Mohammed Ali Malek (centre) bites his nails as he waits to disembark an Italian coastguard ship before being arrested over the deaths of 950 migrants who died when his ship sank . 'Killer': Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the Mediterranean. He has been charged with multiple manslaughter . In the dock: Malek affords a smile alongside his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who was also arrested and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration' A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . Malek was also pictured with his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who charged with 'aiding illegal immigration. Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between \u20ac1million and \u20ac5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat."

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011. North Korea has rejected accusations that it may have been behind the attack as a 'vicious' smear campaign by Seoul.

        "text": "(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \"counterterrorism operation\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3\u00bd  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \"no interest in my case.\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \"one Jew to another\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \"de-conflict\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown."

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer ."

Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay."

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,\u2019 he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll and Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son."

        "text": "(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. \"The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,\" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke ptexts filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue."

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid \u2013 a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. Along with DNA evidence, the shape of the animal's skull indicated it was a hybrid . The cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Pictured are various views of the camel's metacarpus, which is part of its legs . The battle that took place on 11 September 1683 after Vienna had been seiged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. It was won by the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation against the invading Ottoman Empire. Historians claim the battle marked the turning-point in the Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars, a 300-year struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire . The loot that fell into the hands of the Holy League troops and the Viennese was large. King John Sobieski vividly described in a letter to his wife a few days after the battle: . 'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe. 'This means that the animal was not killed and then butchered. It may have been acquired as part of an exchange,' said Galik .

Historians claim the battle marked the turning-point in the Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars, a 300-year struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire . The loot that fell into the hands of the Holy League troops and the Viennese was large. King John Sobieski vividly described in a letter to his wife a few days after the battle: . 'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. The find was made it the town of Tulln . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian (pictured)-dromedary hybrid \u2013 a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time ."

        "text": "(CNN)Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant, long-deceased relative who had owned slaves? Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline? I wouldn't, and neither did Ben Affleck, who lobbied producers of a PBS show, \"Finding Your Roots,\" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole, a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's, in an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. (Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.) Here's the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material: The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to Affleck's request, because when the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. Affleck's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck's request to delete the material, Lynton responded, \"all things being equal, I would definitely take it out.\" And on Tuesday, Affleck, via Facebook, admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck explained, \"I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.\" Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request, but it seems likely that he did. After all, Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates \"agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with.\" And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck's familial slave ownership connection. In any event, PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let's be clear: \"Finding Your Roots\" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It's not \"60 Minutes\" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers. There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  \"asked us to edit out something.\" After the emails were revealed, Gates issued a statement, saying, \"Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a Revolutionary War ancestor, a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964.\" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that's what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel \"vulnerable.\" Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his \"distant relative.\"  That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye."

        "text": "Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made   372m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made   372million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened \u2013 they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job \u2013 but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well \u2013 I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica  in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday. Members of the crew Italian Coast Guard ship Gregoretti prepare to disembark one of the 24 bodies of some of the 800 victims of the migrant boat tragedy in Valletta's Grand Harbour, Malta .

A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized."

        "text": "After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups, former official Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions \u2013 a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to \"testimony\" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS\u2019 actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama\u2019s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated \u2013 but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner \u2013 and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal \u2013 was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS\u2019s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said. DOJ Letter to Boehner About Lois Lerner uploaded by DailyMail.com ."

        "text": "Washington (CNN)ISIS is a problem that is \"off the charts historically\" and has sent the United States into \"uncharted territory\" when it comes to putting down the terror group, the Obama administration's point man in the fight recently told CNN. The comments, which Brett McGurk made in an exclusive interview, were some of the administration's strongest to date in describing the challenge the United States and its allies face in battling ISIS. \"This is a problem that is off the charts historically,\" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. \"Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries.\" He concluded, \"We're in unchartered territory here.\" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. \"We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,\" he said. \"Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do.\" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. \"We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,\" McGurk said. \"They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,\" he acknowledged. \"But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani.\" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: \"The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up."

Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy.

Jamyra Gallmon, 21, has been charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 in Washington, D.C. The woman admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale Donovan hotel with the intention of robbing him. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed on Thursday that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . According to Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing including black boots, black pants and a black hooded jacket, the room door was open when she arrived. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Among the  items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit, Fox DC reported. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com text about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. A woman has been arrested in connection to the murder of 30-year-old Washington, DC lawyer David Messerschmitt. Above, the 'person of interest' who was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9. Police confirmed that this was Gallmon . Jamyra Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland and was an exemplary student, a teacher said on Thursday. According to an affidavit, it is believed that Mr Messerschmitt got her to come to his hotel room believing that he was soliciting a man . Gallmon made an initial appearance on the felony murder charge Superior Court in DC on Thursday. The 21-year-old attended the Forestville Military Academy in Maryland, a coach toldFox 5 on Thursday and had been an exemplary student. She graduated in 2011. Her mother told NBC that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury. He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 5.30pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime. On the left, another view of the person of interest on CCTV and on the right, Messerschmitt. Police sources told NBC Washington that the woman in the surveillance video is Gallmon . Messerschmitt texted his wife Kim Vuong on February 9 that he would be home in an hour but never showed. It appears he had gone to the Donovan hotel after arranging to have sex with an individual on Craigslist who he believed to be a man . Gallmon's mother said that her 21-year-old daughter (pictured) had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. She told police she stabbed the lawyer multiple times, according to an affidavit . Last week, Messerchmitt's wife gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife. He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law. Emotional: Last week, Messerschmitt's wife, Kim Vuong, held a press conference, asking for help in locating her husband's killer . Gallmon told police she had gone to the Donovan hotel (pictured) with the intention of robbing Mr Messerchmitt. He was found stabbed to death in his hotel room on February 10 ."

        "text": "Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country\u2019s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital\u2019s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I\u2019m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe \u2013 the first for 20 years \u2013 supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims\u2019 families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe\u2019s second victim, said: \u2018He tore apart our family and this just looks like he\u2019s being rewarded. He\u2019s getting an easy life and he\u2019s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how many years go by, it doesn\u2019t make the pain of what he did any easier.\u2019 Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than   3300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases."

        "text": "English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience - such as from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job."

        "text": "Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'"

But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster, dressed in full combat gear, from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers, equipped with helmets and body armour, calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from rights groups. More than 100 protesters used catapults to fire rocks at the Israeli forces after violence erupted during  a rally to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day . The Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the West Bank city of Nablus .

The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'"

Surveillance footage shows 40-year-old Todd Phillips being struck at full speed as he flags down one of his drivers  during Sunday's inaugural Indy Grand Prix of Louisiana. As the Dale Coyne Racing team chief mechanic is hit on the leg by the back end of the vehicle he flips forwards and performs a somersault before co-workers rush over to check he's okay. Amazingly Phillips of Franklin, Wisconsin, only sustained minor injuries to his leg which required six stitches. It was later reported that he was mowed down by the car of Francesco Dracone, who had come in on Lap 25 for tires and fuel. Dracone spun while exiting his put box, clipping Phillips' leg. Phillips was taken to the infield care center for treatment where he was swiftly given the all-clear. He told The Indianapolis Star that in almost 20 years of being on the track he had never been hit by a race car before.

After taking a couple of weeks out, he hopes to be ready to return his car-servicing duties for the IndyCar  race in Birmingham, Alabama, on April 26. Many cars struggled with traction during the Louisiana Grand Prix   after rain had fallen for hours leading up to the green flag. Dracone did not finish the race and wound up 23rd.

        "text": "First it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep Aidan Turner's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit BBC Sunday night series Poldark. Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'"

In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader\u2019s personal character \u2013 after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign \u2018into the gutter\u2019. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight\u2019s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage\u2019s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a \u2018tax loophole\u2019 used by wealthy \u2018non doms\u2019 to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight\u2019s poll, nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband\u2019s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters \u2018strongly\u2019 support the move \u2013 with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1,111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives."

Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, \"I'd love to take this girl to dinner.\" David Beckham embarrassed his son Brooklyn on James Corden's Late Late Show in America last month .

Dybala is wanted by Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Inter Milan, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain . Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini watched the Serie A match between Parma and  Palermo on Sunday . Yet the former Manchester City manager's fiercest competition would be Ligue 1 champions PSG, with Palermo determined to cash in. 'I'm in contact with the player's agent and with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi,' Zamparini told Telefoot. 'For PSG, he would be a good investment for the future. 'For me, he is the new Messi.

More than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in Holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables, causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke. Although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely, and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze: The scene in Holborn today, where a fire has been raging for more than 24 hours . Emergency: Firefighters and gas workers were still battling to put out the fire a day later . Plume: Flames rose up from the street in the deserted part of central London today . Continuing: Firefighters spraying water into a manhole in a bid to put out a fire in Holborn . Much of the area is cordoned off as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire, while there were reports of major delays in central London. Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible, and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway, where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed, as is the Strand underpass, while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted, and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn, but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1,000 buildings remain without power today, with businesses, government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage: Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matin\u00e9e performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London."

        "text": "Former Queens Park Rangers chairman Gianni Paladini has registered as a director of a new Bradford City holding company in what appears to be the first move towards taking control at Valley Parade. Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson\u2019s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club\u2019s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson\u2019s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese\u2019s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini\u2019s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City\u2019s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford\u2019s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes."

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table.

After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved ."

        "text": "Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters were just about to renew their lucrative contacts for three more years but they were scrapped when the star punched the show's producer. James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare  200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a   3200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for \u2013 let's not be shy \u2013 a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at   3208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.' James May (right) was vague on the future for the trio, hinting that they may be reunited on screen ."

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation."

        "text": "For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel."

Two Florida corrections officers and one former officer trainee have been charged in a plot to kill a former inmate who was getting out of prison, the Florida Attorney General's office said Thursday. An FBI informant met the men -- Thomas Jordan Driver, 25; David Elliot Moran, 47; and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 -- after infiltrating a branch of the KKK:  the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, CNN affiliate WJXT reported. Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him \"six feet under,\" according to court documents. To convince the suspects that the deed had been done, the FBI staged a fake homicide scene with the former inmate and took pictures to show them that he had been killed. \"When the FBI staged this crime scene and these photographs were shown to each of these men, they were happy about it,\" said Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox. The three men are now facing up to 30 years in jail if convicted on one count each of conspiracy to commit murder. \"We will not tolerate nor will we ever remain silent over the violence of hatred embedded in prejudice in this country,\" Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

The Spaniard has been linked with the managerial job at Sampdoria after it emerged that Sinisa Mihajlovic - the current Blucerchiati boss - is being lined up to replace Benitez at Napoli. But Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has taken inspiration from a favourite chant of the Goodison Park and Old Trafford terraces, appearing to quash rumours that a job swap is imminent. Napoli manager Rafael Benitez jokes with Switzerland Gokhan Inler (right) during a training session . Benitez challenges  Argentinian forward Gonzalo Higuain during a training session earlier today . 'I could take Benitez, but I'd have to take him to see a dietician first,' Ferrero told Radio Crc. 'Anyway, if Mihajlovic does leave, I've already got a replacement. You all say he's leaving, even if I don't know anything about it. 'As far as I am concerned, he's staying. If he were to leave, I'd know who to replace him with. Paulo Sousa's not going to be Sampdoria's next coach, it will be [Italian comedy actor] Lino Banfi.' Sampdoria travel to face Napoli on Sunday trailing Benitez's side by three points, but Ferrero said he would rather keep hold of the Serbian Mihajlovic, who has guided the Genoa-based club from relegation candidates to European contenders in 18 months. 'Napoli would not be taking a step backwards if they were to get Mihajlovic,' Ferrero said. 'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after. Above everything, he's got incredible ability and if he does leave, then I'm sure whoever gets him will be hitting the jackpot. But they're going to have to wait another year because he's still got a year on his contract with us.' Benitez instructs his players during training ahead of tomorrow's Europa League clash with VFL Wolfsburg ."

        "text": "Labour peer John Prescott has defended Prince Charles over allegations he tries to secretly influence government policy with scrawled private notes to ministers - insisting he should 'right to 'write as many damn letters as he likes'. The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had 'a lot to offer this country'. Lord Prescott's intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles's so-called 'black spider' memos. Lord Prescott, left, said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott, whose letters are separate to those due to be released, said that while he is 'not a raving loyalist', he has 'a lot of time for Charles' who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters, he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said: ' Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. 'And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work, combating climate change and building sustainable communities, he can write as many damn letters as he likes.' Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince - including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician's mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved 'the measure of the man'. He said: 'They show he has nothing to hide and he shouldn't be worried about publication.' The first letter is a typed   dinvitation to a meeting of Regional  d   dDevelopment Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be 'splendid' to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince's   ddistinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott's mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has 'been overdoing the quota' of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles - with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week - does a lot of good for the country, according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this \u2013 and the 'trouble' the press would give him \u2013 he goes on to express his sadness and says his 'heart goes out' to the politician. He added: 'I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he shouldn't be writing to ministers but he's quite entitled to express his opinion. 'Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter \u2013 even from Prince Charles \u2013 to unduly   dinfluence them.' Prince Charles has long been accused of 'bombarding' ministers with 'black spider' memos attacking government policy. His letters are so-named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both  Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect,  according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve, the prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'."

Many celebrities now promote products and luxury brands via Twitter in return for either payment or freebies. Rap star Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan are among the famous names who have been paid by big businesses to promote products to their massive Twitter followings. In leaked Sony emails in December, it was revealed that comedian Kevin Hart had been paid $2 million to send out tweets to his 14.8 million followers promoting The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, and the Idris Elba film No Good Deed.

Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We\u2019ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there\u2019s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won\u2019t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out \u2018Tinder Plus\u2019, a premium service allowing people to \u2018undo\u2019 a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of \u2018likes\u2019 a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them \u2018You\u2019re Out of Likes\u2019, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says \u2018Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus\u2019. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around   31.49 a month to as high as   314.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay   317.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping   3179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying   3162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service."

        "text": "A personal trainer who claims to have helped Gwen Stefani get into shape hit a woman so hard that she lost a tooth and was left lying unconscious in a pool of blood, a court has hard. Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour. At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a   37,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'I\u2019m so happy for Mike that he\u2019s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I can\u2019t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour. 'Mike is completely passionate about health and fitness and is a wonderful motivator. 'He is tireless, compassionate and makes working out something to look forward to. He is the Superman of my tour.'"

A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker \u2013 who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche \u2013 described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise   345,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London,  escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge . Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers \u2013 from South Africa \u2013 managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London \u2013 Chloe Pincho and Brennan White \u2013 were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover. Amanda Holden said her sister Debbie was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness ."

        "text": "In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him \u2013 to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday \u2013 where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump\u2019s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump \u2013 In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment."

Four Turkish soldiers also were wounded in the fighting that took place in the eastern city of Agri, the armed forces said in a written statement. The Kurdish separatists opened fire from a long distance, targeting Turkish soldiers who were securing an area in Agri ahead of a spring festival, CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the violence and said via Twitter that \"the appropriate answer to the heinous attack in Agri is being given by the Turkish armed forces.\" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also harshly condemned the attack, describing it as the Kurdish separatists' attempt to \"intervene in the resolution process (with the Kurds) in our country.\" Last month, Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), called from his jail cell for the violence to end. In a historic letter, he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a \"congress\" to focus on the future. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost. The conflict has been, some say, a battle by activists among Turkey's Kurdish minority for independence. It has been, others say, a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts. About a fifth of Turkey's population is Kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression, most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of Turkey. From Turkish prison, Kurdish leader tells followers to lay down their arms ."

        "text": "An Israeli geologist claims he has \u2018confirmed\u2019 the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary \u2013 a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother \u2013 to the long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) \u2013 a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead \u2013 to the long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019 and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron\u2019s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, \u2018Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron\u2019s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, \u2018James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus\u2019. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the \u2018crust\u2019 of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries \u2013 15 of which were from unrelated tombs \u2013 and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of \u2018Rendzina\u2019 soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the \u2018holy\u2019 location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, \u2018Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: \u2018This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 Dr Shumron told The New York Times: \u2018I think I\u2019ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.\u2019 The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: \u2018 The evidence is beyond what I expected.\u2019 The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv."

The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of   39,000 a year to   36,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of   39,000 a year to   36,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP\u2019s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called \u2018modest\u2019 spending increases funded by yet more borrowing \u2013 but which in fact total   3180billion over five years. Scotland\u2019s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a \u2018progressive alliance\u2019 for people \u2018right across the UK\u2019. \u2018There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,\u2019 she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. Today\u2019s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party\u2019s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a \u2018strong team\u2019 of SNP MPs in Westminster would help \u2018rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected\u2019. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year\u2019s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. \u2018We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland\u2019s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn\u2019t leave the UK but lead the UK,\u2019 she said. \u2018So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland\u2019s voice shouldn\u2019t be heard or that Scotland\u2019s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.\u2019 However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today\u2019s launch over her plans for \u2018full fiscal autonomy\u2019 or effective \u2018home rule\u2019, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a \u2018fiscally autonomous\u2019 Scotland would have a   37.6billion black hole in its finances."

Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very \u2013 or morbidly \u2013 obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity \u2013 classified as a BMI of more than 40 \u2013 could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making \"stereotypical assumptions\" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed."

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC. Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline. A spokesman for Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said Australia should lead efforts against the death penalty, 'in particular working with the United Nations'.

The Gunners are keen on the Reds forward, who is stalling on a new   3100,000-per-week contract at Anfield. But it is understood the 20-year-old's tempestuous fortnight has not gone unnoticed by members of the Emirates Stadium hierarchy. Arsenal may pull out of the running to sign Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling following recent events . Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . Sterling's decision to hold his now infamous BBC interview without Liverpool's permission is said to have surprised those at north London. Likewise, the fact he has been caught smoking shisha and inhaling nitrous oxide has not gone down well at Arsenal. And the FA Cup holders are now having second thoughts over their interest in the England international fearing similar scenarios could tarnish the club's reputation. Arsene Wenger has condemned the likes of Jack Wilshere and Wojciech Szczesny over smoking incidents . England and Arsenal midfielder Wilshere (right) was involved in a smoking controversy back in February . It remains to be seen whether Arsene Wenger, who has been outspoken in his views against smoking, presses ahead with his interest in Sterling this summer.

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal\u2019s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal\u2019s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley\u2019s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield\u2019s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes\u2019 aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal\u2019s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean\u2019s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley\u2019s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems . Olivier Giroud holds the ball up, but couldn't add to his six-game goalscoring run at Turf Moor ."

Rita Ora has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range, so FEMAIL caught up with the global star to find out her influences and plans for the future . Speaking to FEMAIL about the inspiration behind her new range, which is emblazoned with graphic dragon prints and lands on May 1, Rita said: 'The Dragon print is all about my love of travel and soaking up different cultures. The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. 'I\u2019ve contrasted that with the fit, basketball style cuts, which were inspired by American culture.

But it is best known for that infamous scene in the 1986 teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The car, in classic Ferrari red, was the pride and joy of the father of Ferris Bueller's best friend Cameron in the movie. That was until the friends take the model out for a spin which results in the convertible accidentally smashing through its glass showroom doors into the ravine below.

In the movie, Ferris took best friend Cameron's dad's red model out without permission but the car eventually trashed . You killed the car: In one of the film world's best-known scenes, the beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below after Cameron accidentally knocks it off the jack . This car, however, is in significantly better condition and has recently undergone a full restoration by Ferrari in Maranello.

The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'"

        "text": "Britain's five highest-earning NHS dentists are paid average salaries of   3690,000 a year. The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister\u2019s   3142,500 pay packet \u2013 and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices. A further 11 dentists were paid between   3400,000 and   3500,000 and a total of 177 received more than   3200,000. More than 1,600 pocketed   3100,000-  3200,000. The figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money paid to dentists for NHS work, following Labour\u2019s introduction of controversial contracts in 2006. Scroll down for video . Lucrative: Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts, as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were \u2018scandalous\u2019 and \u2018unacceptable\u2019. Under freedom of information laws, the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13, the latest figures available, five practitioners were paid more than   3500,000. They shared a total of about   33.4million \u2013 an average of   3690,000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned   3400,000 to   3499,999 from the NHS, 30 received   3300,000 to   3399,999, 131 pocketed   3200,000 to   3299,999 and 1,617 received   3100,000 to   3199,999. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the rates of pay were \u2018exorbitant\u2019. Yesterday's Daily Mail . She added: \u2018Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [and] patients waiting for hours in A&E \u2026 when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure, this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.\u2019 It follows revelations in Thursday\u2019s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday, the Mail also exposed a   32,700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals \u2013 treble the cost to the health service \u2013 raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern\u2019s Roger Goss said: \u2018This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists\u2019 pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. \u2018There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands, suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.\u2019 Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance, which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research, said the salaries show a \u2018shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride\u2019. He added: \u2018It is outrageous that these telephone-number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them \u2026 Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients, not on bumper pay packets.\u2019 The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year, rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday's Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands, from a simple check-up earning the dentist   325, to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns, for roughly   3300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds, and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 21,500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13, but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association\u2019s Mick Armstrong said the top-earning dentists \u2018most likely own a group of practices\u2019 or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee of MPs, said: \u2018Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.\u2019 A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self-employed individuals or companies, some of whom \u2018earn income from a number of contracts\u2019."

        "text": "Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on   330billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra   326billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly   33 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was   387.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from   398.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of   390.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than   360 billion from   3153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of   31.48 trillion is more than   3500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of   3956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the   35 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the   310 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around   330 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at   326billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed   3200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left   3350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a   3140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add   36billion to Britain's interest bill, worth   3350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

        "text": "Marathon season is in full swing with the London Marathon set to take place a week on Sunday. The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for   3130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out   3130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget   319.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of   319.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost,   3130: Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At   3130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of   3130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes,   319.99: The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for   314.99 in 2013. Aldi's   319.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At   319.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the   3130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts."

        "text": "An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory, an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic: Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm. Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death . He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. 'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. 'His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. 'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse.' Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest: 'He said, \"Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall.\" I remember saying, \"Why, what happened?\" He said, \"He has fallen from a ladder.\" 'I asked if he was OK and he said he didn't know as he wasn't conscious. He said, \"You need to get here as soon as you can mum.\" I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. 'I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him.' Workplace: Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights. 'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence.' Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT.' He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking \"danger high voltage\". I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. 'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. 'That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. 'I'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.' The inquest continues."

        "text": "The England C team is facing the axe after 36 years as part of Greg Dyke\u2019s spending review at the Football Association. FA chairman Dyke must find   330million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough\u2019s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year\u2019s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23 . Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level. George Boyd (right) played for the England C team before switching allegiances and playing for Scotland ."

The image followed another photo he posted  displaying several packs of Pringles, Kinder chocolate, Oreos, M&Ms and even pre-mixed cans of mojitos. It's not the first time ISIS fighters have been caught with fast food sneaked across the border. Last month a delighted fighter known only as Ghareeb posted a picture of a McDonalds bag on his social media page. According to the fighter, one of his friends allegedly managed to bring in a bag full of five cheeseburgers when they traveled into Syria. Starved of any variety in his diet, the fighter tweeted it was first time in two years since he last ate one of McDonalds' famous products.

But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead, with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today\u2019s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls, enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent, but that compared with a four-point deficit for Ed Miliband's Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror, while the Conservatives dipped one, to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader - despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent - will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said last week that \u2018a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine\u2019 given Labour\u2019s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain\u2019 s membership of the European Union. \u2018Labour would be tough on business \u2013 and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,\u2019 the US giant said in the report. \u2018A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK\u2019s EU membership. \u2018Whoever wins \u2013 and the result could take some time to emerge \u2013 will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.\u2019 BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be \u2018harrowing for the UK\u2019."

Currently, a total of 215,462 licences exist compared to the 177,675 owned in 2010, according to figures obtained by News Corp. Tamworth, 403km north of Sydney, was revealed to have the most number of firearm licences - 3259 - with Bathurst, 200km west of Sydney, a close second at 3075. Currently, a total of 215,462 licences exist in New South Wales compared to the 177,675 owned in 2010. Pictured: NSW police busted an illegal firearm operation in the Casino and Lismore areas last month . Both suburbs saw an increase of almost 500 guns in their areas over the last five years. Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'. Tamworth, 403km north of Sydney, was revealed to have the most number of firearm licences - 3259 - with Bathurst, 200km west of Sydney, a close second at 3075.

The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain's highest mountain. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31. The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene. Search and rescue dogs also joined in the hunt for missing Kyle. Rescuers were forced to call off the hunt due to band weather in the Scottish Highlands. Today, a body was recovered by a Royal Navy Helicopter in the Surgeon's Gully area, to the south east of Ben Nevis. It has been identified as that of Mr Knox and his family have been informed. It was believed that Mr Knox, 23, of London, was attempting to scale the 4409-ft high peak alone ."

Luke has been missing for two nights in a Victorian national park, with temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius on Saturday night. However, he may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. According the Herald Sun, the 11-year-old was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . Police assume Luke has spent 36 hours without food or water and on Saturday night would have experienced temperatures as low as 8 degree Celsius. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke. Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.'

The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'"

A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted \u2013 with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult\u2019s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were \u2018significantly\u2019 more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were \u2018significantly\u2019 more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: \u2018Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.\u2019 A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say \"shaped\", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'"

The three-year-old was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya, who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife, in January last year. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular's (left) confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high-profile case without permission. Adekoya, who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine, was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister's home. Investigations found her internet history included searches 'I find it hard to love my son', 'I love all of my children except one', 'why am I so aggressive with my son' and 'get rid of bruises'. Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial, the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 \u2013 the month before Mikaeel's death. Tragic: Scores of tributes were left near to the youngster's home in Edinburgh following a massive search to find him . Grim discovery: The three-year-old's body was found in woodland behind his auntie's house in Fife . However, Adekoya was not on the radar of social workers in Edinburgh, despite having moved to the Scottish capital. Craig Munro, Executive Director of Education and Children's Services at Fife council said: . 'We have a clear internal process for dealing with discipline issues and we don't comment publicly on the individual circumstances of staff.' A seperate investigation into whether Mikaeel's death could have been prevented is due to be published in a matter of weeks. Police Scotland said they would not be taking the matter further. A spokesman said: 'No criminal complaint had been made so we consider it an internal matter for Fife Council.'"

An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly told the 18-year-old, from Sierra Leone, that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee, 46, as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said: 'He was like someone I could really lean on because, going for some interviews with him, he would ask me everything about my personal life, everything, because he said that is the procedure they need to do. 'So it is like I took him as a father, or someone I can relate to, or maybe understand what is happening to me.' Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him - she initially ignored him, but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee, he slapped her bottom as she left the office, and she told him 'never do that'. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied: 'He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him, and his status, all these things, I believed him.' Describing the alleged rape, the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office, and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said: 'He said there was a delay for me to pay the money, that if the visa didn't come, I can't go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. 'He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office, and he told me that he was going to help and I said, \"How are you going to do that?\" He just said, \"A call that I can make,\" and I said \"Why don't you do it?\" 'He said: \"You know what you can do that will make me do it.\"' Base: Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the 'boss' who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later, told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area, jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform, Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office, before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said: 'He came back and sat, he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him.' Jurors heard that she told Mee 'no' and that she was simply there to see the 'boss', still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know, and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then 'jumped' and kissed her on the lips, before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her, before she told him that she could not breathe. 'I was suffocating because he was on top of me,' the woman said. 'And I told him that I was suffocating, he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me, because I wasn't breathing.' After the incident Mee drove the woman home, telling her not to tell anyone what had happened, and said that he was helping her out, the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was 'a big person in the Army' and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards, the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted, and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant: Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee, who now lives in Scotland, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped, she said: 'Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. 'Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me, if they don't agree he said he will marry me. LOL. 'That is so sweet of him. God, please don't let anything happen to me.' In cross-examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her 'jokingly or seriously'. 'That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought, because he is telling me all these things that I wasn't aware of,' she replied. In another entry a few days later, she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote: 'I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he didn't call, they should have refused me.' Asked why she hadn't told anyone of the rape, the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said: 'He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child doesn't know that you are abusing it, and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt.' The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this text."

Russia has key interests in . common with the United States and needs to work with it on a . common agenda, Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Saturday . in a television interview. In his comments to the state-run Rossiya channel, Putin . appeared to soften his anti-American rhetoric after being highly . critical. Relations between Moscow and Washington, and other . Western powers, have soured over the conflict in Russia's . neighbor Ukraine, sinking to an all-time low. 'We have disagreements on several issues on the . international agenda. 'But at the same time there is something . that unites us, that forces us to work together,' Putin said. 'I mean general efforts directed at making the world economy . more democratic, measured and balanced, so that the world order . is more democratic. 'We have a common agenda.' Putin has in the past fiercely attacked the United States . and the West in general, blaming them for the Ukraine crisis, . which Russia says was the result of a Western-backed 'coup' against Ukraine's former leader Viktor Yanukovich. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations from Kiev and the . West that it is supporting pro-Russian rebels with troops and . weapons in eastern Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have . been killed since last April. His latest remark comes two days after an annual TV phone-in . show in which Putin accused the United States of trying to . dominate world affairs, saying it wanted 'not allies, but . vassals'. On Saturday, Putin (pictured above with U.S. president Obama in November 2014 at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit) said the U.S. and Russia have a common agenda of general efforts directed at making the world economy more democratic, measured and balanced . During the Thursday interview, he also made it clear that Russia wants an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and is interested in rebuilding damaged ties with the United States and other Western nations. The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia over Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and accusations of supporting separatists in Ukraine. At the same time, he reaffirmed his long-held criticism of what he sees as U.S. aspirations of global domination, saying Washington must learn to treat Russia as an equal partner. 'The main condition for restoring normal relations is to have respect for Russia and its interests,' Putin said on Thursday, adding that the United States 'doesn't need allies; they need vassals.' However, his criticisms of the West on Saturday were more moderate . than in some previous appearances. But, both Russia and the West say they back a peace deal . agreed in Minsk in February, as a result of which a ceasefire in . the Donbass region is largely holding."

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court."

        "text": "As Zlatan Ibrahimovic famously believes the World Cup is 'nothing to watch' without him, he's unlikely to be quaking in his boots about facing Lionel Messi in the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. For most people, Barcelona's progress into the Champions League semi-final looks a formality given they beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the first leg in France. The only man bound to disagree is the one who modestly called his autobiography 'I am Zlatan'. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is put through his paces with Blaise Matuidi (left) and Zoumana Camara at the Nou Camp . Ibrahimovic and his PSG team-mates, including David Luiz, pictured, face Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Sweden international was suspended for the first leg after he was dismissed against Chelsea . At 33, Ibrahimovic is past caring what other people think of him. With an ego that makes Louis van Gaal look like a shrinking violet, he'll walk down the tunnel at the Nou Camp convinced in his own mind that Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez will be in awe of him. When asked to name a dream team of team-mates he'd played with, he named himself up front with Messi \u2013 ahead of Thierry Henry and Alessandro del Piero. 'Football isn't something you plan in advance. It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him   3200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to   350million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance \u2013 except for Zlatan himself."

        "text": "Jameela spent   33,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent   33,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly. Jameela is supporting Allergy UK to raise awareness of food allergies and is ambassador for Holland & Barrett\u2019s Free From range ."

        "text": "A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'"

'Game Ready', as seen being used by Thiago Silva, is a cold therapy compression system used to treat sports injuries. It circulates cold water around the injury, cooling it down with the aim to bring players back from injury as soon as possible. He posted an update on Instagram, writing: 'Guys, I'm here to thank you all for your prayers!

PSG coach Laurent Blanc said on Friday: 'Thiago Silva is out for Nice even if his injury is not as bad as first feared.' The game against Nice comes more than 24 hours before league leaders Lyon face a tough task at home against fifth-place St Etienne. A win in south east France would put the French champions a point clear of their closest rivals. Lyon could take back top spot on Sunday but Blanc's side will have a game in hand at the close of the weekend. 'It is not easy to prepare for this match,' Blanc said. 'We must turn in up in championship mode. In this final stretch, we no longer have room for error.' Laurent Blanc said that Silva's injury is not as bad as first feared, and that was confirmed by the Brazilian .

        "text": "(CNN)You know the phrase \"dodging a bullet\"? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the \"smart bullets\" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman \"repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,\" a DARPA statement said. \"Additionally,\" the statement said, \"a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target.\" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. \"True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,\" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. \"This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,\" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said."

Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread . Dinner: Chicken Kiev with potato croquettes and chips . Snacks: Crisps . Breakfast: Porridge with berries . Lunch: Scrambled eggs with ham and mushrooms . Dinner: Chicken stir-fry . Snacks: Throughout the day she snacks on yoghurt and fresh fruit ."

EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers. 'Ryanair said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options - full refund, free transfer onto next available flight or free transfer onto an alternative flight routing.'"

After his strike against Rayo Vallecano, the Portuguese forward now has 300 goals for Los Blancos, despite having played in Madrid for only six seasons, amassing 288 appearances. He has well and truly made his name as a legend at the Santiago Bernabeu, only trailing Raul and Alfredo di Stefano in the club standings. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 300 goals for Real Madrid in just six years with the La Liga giants . The Portuguese forward is catching Raul's (l) club record and is just seven goals shy of Alfredo di Stefano (r) Ronaldo heads home his 300th goal for the club - against Rayo Vallecano at the Vallecas Stadium in Madrid . 323 - Raul . 308 - Alfredo di Stefano . 300 - Cristiano Ronaldo . 289 - Carlos Santillana . 242 - Ferenc Puskas . Ronaldo has scored 206 with his right foot, 52 with his left, even managing 41 with his head. 46 of his goals at Real have been outside the box, many of them screamers. After claiming two FIFA Ballon d'Or awards during his time in Spain, as well as glory in La Liga and the Champions League, many would be running out of motivation, scratching around for more records to break. But Ronaldo, 30, doesn't only have the status of Raul or Di Stefano to look up to, but also Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, who is younger, and seemingly still improving. But there are other poachers that have formed their goalscoring reputation at one club, including a Portugal legend and an Everton hero who the former Manchester United man could draw inspiration from. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring his first goal (vs Deportivo in 2009, above), and his most recent (below) THE TOP 10 ONE-CLUB SCORERS OF ALL TIME . 10) Dixie Dean, Everton (1925-37) 383 . Dean is the widely regarded as greatest player to have been born on Merseyside, and scored 60 goals in one league season in 1927/28. Impressed? He achieved that record after fracturing his skull and jaw in a motorcycling accident. Former Everton striker Dixie Dean is widely regarded as the greatest striker ever born on Merseyside . 9) Willy van der Kuijlen, PSV (1964-81) 394 . When his career started in Eindhoven, part of Der Kuijlen's motivation was to work at Phillips. He ended up with almost 400 goals, and was still only capped 22 times by the Dutch national side. Willy van der Kuijlen of PSV runs with the ball in the UEFA Cup match against Bastia in 1978 . 8) Lionel Messi, Barcelona (2004-present) 398* . Staggeringly, this Argentine forward is only 27. As the star of a mightily impressive Barelona team, expect Messi to climb up this list considerably over the next 10 years. Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer . CHELSEA . 211 - Frank Lampard (2001-14) 202 - Bobby Tambling (1959-70) 193 - Kerry Dixon (1983-92) EVERTON . 383 - Dixie Dean (1925-37) 159 - Graeme Sharp (1980-91) 138 - Bob Latchford (1974-81) LIVERPOOL . 346 - Ian Rush (1980-87 and 1988-96) 286 - Roger Hunt (1958-69) 241 - Gordon Hodgson (1925-36) Ian Rush netted 346 times over two spells with Liverpool and is streaks ahead of anyone else in the charts . MANCHESTER CITY . 178 - Eric Brook (1928-39) 166 - Tommy Johnson (1920-30) 153 - Colin Bell (1966-1979) MANCHESTER UNITED . 249 - Sir Bobby Charlton (1956-73) 237 - Denis Law (1962-73) 230* Wayne Rooney (2004-present) Wayne Rooney is just 19 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton at Manchester United after his recent strike . NEWCASTLE . 206 - Alan Shearer (1996-2006) 200 - Jackie Milburn (1946-57) 153 - Len White (1953-62) Alan Shearer scored 206 goals for Newcastle, while Vic Watson managed 326 for West Ham United . TOTTENHAM . 266 - Jimmy Greaves (1961-70) 208 - Bobby Smith (1955-64) 174 - Martin Chivers (1968-76) WEST HAM . 326 -  Vic Watson (1920-35) 252 - Geoff Hurst (1959-72) 166 - John Dick (1953\u201363) 166 - Jimmy Ruffell (1921-37)"

        "text": "The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England\u2019s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell\u2019s century. But \u2018the Burnley Lara\u2019, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England\u2019s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith\u2019s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four. Jos Buttler fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . West Indies fast bowler celebrates after dismissing Buttler for a duck on day two of the first Test . Stuart Broad was England's ninth wicket to fall before Anderson fell for 20 with the score on 399 . Anderson celebrates after seeing Devon Smith edge behind to Buttler to take England's first wicket . Buttler makes the catch from Anderson's bowling to dismiss Smith for 11 and leave West Indies 19 for one . Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord\u2019s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India\u2019s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England\u2019s noses in front until the wait for Anderson\u2019s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test."

Adam netted one of the most memorable goals in Premier League history as he lobbed Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from 66 yards on the stroke of half-time. That levelled the scores up at 1-1, but Adam's wonder strike would end up counting for nothing as Chelsea snatched a second-half winner to leave Stoke nursing a third successive league loss. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Stoke ended up losing 2-1 at Stamford Bridge as Loic Remy (left) scored the winner for Chelsea . And while Adam was understandably proud of his 'incredible' goal, the Scotland international admits the main thing for him is how the team get on and he was quick to turn his focus to next weekend's clash with West Ham. Asked if it was the greatest goal of his career, Adam said on Stoke Player: 'Of course. It's an incredible strike, it's a nice goal to score but the important thing for us is winning the game. 'It's three on the bounce we've lost now, which is bad, but hopefully we can improve on that next week against West Ham. 'On an individual level it's great, but on a team performance it was ok and there's a lot that we can improve on for next week.' Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . Stoke manager Mark Hughes has seen his side lose in their last three Premier League encounters . West Ham are currently ninth in the standings, one spot ahead of Stoke, but both teams have 42 points. Adam added: 'It's going to be a tough game. They're in and around us as well. If we can win that will keep us in the top 10, a few points ahead of them and hopefully we can do that with two homes games to come.'"

        "text": "Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn\u2019t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn\u2019t that much more, but when you\u2019re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children \u2014 she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'"

Molly Wood, 74, died after the burgundy Kia Venga had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels. The pensioner's sister, 70, who was about to buy a pay and display ticket, was also injured in the incident. Tragedy: Pensioner Molly Wood died after being run over by her sister's car in a Tesco car park . Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25. Her sister was also hurt in the accident but escaped with minor injuries. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.' He said a provisional post-mortem examination showed Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, died of multiple injuries. Scene: Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured . Detective Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'The incident took place around midday on Wednesday, March 25 when the car, a burgundy coloured Kia Venga, was unoccupied and lurched forward colliding with two women who were standing towards the front of the vehicle. 'As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, a 74-year-old woman from Knottingley died at the scene. 'The other woman, 70, was not seriously injured in the incident but has been left badly shaken by what took place. 'This was a very tragic incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and is yet to speak to police.' The inquest was adjourned for further inquiries."

Adele Berry has told of her shock after she was bombarded with texts from a Vodafone call centre worker . Ms Berry was put through to a call centre in South Africa when she phoned the company over the issue last month. She says she made small talk with the man who answered the query to fill 'dead air', but did nothing to suggest she was interested in him. The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons . The man has sent her 18 messages since she made the call, some of which have referred to his family in Liverpool, making Ms Berry fear he may try to approach her. She told the Manchester Evening News: 'It is quite scary, it is quite distressing. He won't leave me alone. Being pestered by someone I don't know gets me quite nervous.' The man has now been suspended by Vodafone, which says it has a number of call centres in the UK but also sends some callers through to their office in South Africa. A spokesman said: 'We take allegations of this kind extremely seriously. We have spoken to Ms Berry and the adviser concerned has been suspended pending a full investigation.'"

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members \u2013 something that anyone can become by joining free \u2013 while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury. The former Wimbledon champion \u2013 currently practising in Spain before beginning his Spring clay court campaign \u2013 is pleased with the venue, and may be called upon to play doubles as well as two singles matches."

And the Southampton defender, who is being tracked by Manchester United and Chelsea, has fuelled talk that he could quit St Mary's this summer by insisting he wants to play Champions League football. Clyne's excellent displays for the Saints have thrust him into the forefront of Hodgson's plans. Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne poses with a WWE title belt while attending a pay-per-view event . Clyne joined Carlton Cole (left) to speak at at a Football Fighting Ebola event in London . He has started England's previous four matches - including the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovenia and Lithuania. Tottenham's Kyle Walker and Arsenal's Calum Chambers are also in contention for England's right-back berth - but Clyne has revealed Hodgson has told him the shirt is his as long as he keeps on performing. Speaking at the Football Fighting Ebola fundraising event in London, he said: 'Roy just said that \"You\u2019ve done ever so well since coming in. It\u2019s like you have been playing international football for a long time. The right back spot is yours at the moment, if you can continue on\". 'I\u2019ve settled in well with the England squad. If I keep on putting in performances and keep on improving as a player, I can hopefully make the position my own and look to make tournaments and hopefully win tournaments with England as well.' Southampton have opened talks with Clyne, who was spotted at a WWE event in the capital on Monday night, over a new contract but face a huge fight to keep him beyond the end of the season. United are understood to be leading the race to land Clyne in the summer, but Chelsea have entered the race for his signature. The Southampton defender has been linked with a move to Chelsea and Manchester United . And the 24-year-old has openly admitted he is eager to start his Champions League career. 'I see myself hopefully playing in the Champions League and competing for titles and trophies. That\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for,' he said. 'I\u2019m definitely ambitious. Every player would love to be playing Champions League and winning trophies and titles. 'That\u2019s what you play football for, that\u2019s the dream. 'I would say Champions League is the next step in my progression. I think I need experience playing European football. 'We\u2019re doing well with Southampton. Hopefully we can get there.

Pictures of Szczesny's Arsenal career hang from the ceiling in a touching tribute to the goalkeeper . There are also pictures from Szczesny's childhood and family holidays as the goalkeeper turns 25 . Szczesny was clearly touched by the efforts of his girlfriend and took to Instagram on Monday to thank her. 'Best birthday ever!' he wrote. Arsenal's triumph over Reading sees them reach the FA Cup final for the second consecutive season, having also won the competition last year against Hull City. This year, it will be Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa who stand between the Gunners and more glory, after they defeated Liverpool in the other semi-final on Sunday. Szczesny joined Arsenal's academy in 2006 from hometown club Legia Warsaw and graduated to the first-team in three years later. Although he has racked up nearly 200 appearances for the north London outfit since then, this season has raised question marks over Szczesny's long-term future. He was caught smoking in the wake of Arsenal's 2-0 Premier League loss at Southampton on New Year's Day and has only made Cup appearances since then. Factor in the form of fellow goalkeeper David Ospina, who inherited Szczesny's role in the league and there is a cloud of uncertainty around the Polish stopper. Szczesny prepares to blow out candles on the cake presented to him by his girlfriend . Szczesny makes a wish as the cake his held by Luczenko during the birthday celebrations on Saturday .

        "text": "Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that\u2019s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment."

Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2013 which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues \u2013 but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE \u2013 WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I\u2019m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience \u2013 but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move \u2013 sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it \u2013 means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably \u2013 or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version \u2013 and Arkansas' \u2013 expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration."

        "text": "Vladimir Putin is planning to exploit the threat of nuclear war to force Nato out of countries bordering Russia, it has been claimed. A secret meeting between intelligence figures in Moscow and Washington reportedly revealed Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region. Notes from the meeting are also said to have revealed that Putin is planning imminent 'destabilising actions' in pro-Western Baltic states in a direct challenge to Nato's promise to defend the countries from Soviet-style Russian expansionism. These disturbances are thought to likely involve cyber attacks or ramping up local ethnic tensions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania intended to unsettle the region. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Firepower: Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukrainian military (pictured) - who hope to defeat pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country - as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border . In Crimea, Russia is understood to have said that any attempt remove the region from Russian control would be met 'forcefully including through the use of nuclear force'. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. It is the threat posed by Russia to the Baltic states that is thought to be imminent, however, after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all raised concerns that Moscow has ambitions in the former Soviet territories, prompting Nato to establish a 'rapid reaction force' in the region. The threat of a Russian invasion of the countries is currently considered so great that Lithuania has gone as far as to reintroduce conscription in order to ensure it is prepared for all out conflict. Ready for conflict: Soldiers take part on in action training near the eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine . News of the growing tensions emerged as a new men's clothing label launched in Russia in the hope of cashing in on the wave of patriotism currently sweeping the country. The move comes ahead of a giant military parade planned in Red Square on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of end of the Second World War underscoring the decisive contribution of the Red Army to defeating Hitler and the Nazis. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. The design bureau of the Russian Defence Ministry, headed by Leonid Alexeev, showcased balaclavas, shiny 'military boots', sweat pants and tops emblazoned with the slogans 'Army', 'Polite', and 'Politeness conquests the cities'. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region."

Kevin Pietersen is pictured leaving The Oval for the first time since resigning for Surrey last month . Pietersen returned to nets at Surrey on Monday and left The Oval after training finished just before 2pm . Pietersen was pictured driving away from The Oval in his expensive Telsa sports car . Pietersen managed a wry smile as he drove away after training on Monday afternoon . Pietersen was later pictured leaving the ground just before 2pm and is expected to step-up his county rehabilitation with  a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12. Ultimately, Pietersen is hoping to impress enough for Surrey to earn a re-call to the England side - possibly for this summer's Ashes rematch - having been sacked by the national side in 2014. England left for the West Indies for their upcoming Test series on Thursday, with coach Peter Moores leaving KP in no doubt that he still has a lot to prove - despite incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves appearing to extended an olive branch to the exiled batsman. Asked at Gatwick about Pietersen's situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.'"

After four separate requests to speak to a manager, the customer finally got the employee's attention. A complaint about an unsatisfactory milkshake served at a Louisiana branch of Burger King quickly turned ugly when the employee started cursing before getting physical with the customer . The customer then asked for a refund, but the exchange quickly descended into a heated argument and the member of staff starts to curse at the customer. 'Baby, you're about to get it,' the employee is heard saying. 'Just wait. You're gonna get your s***.' 'You're cursing,' the customer replied. 'Are you serious? Are you serious?'

Over the past week, thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake, but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause. More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench, sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by. Clearing: Rio's waste management company said it has cleared more than 37 tons of fish, which have been taken to the city's main dump . Olympics: Rodrigo de Freitas lake is set to host the Olympic rowing and canoeing events during next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . There is an overwhelming stench coming from the lake and authorities and biologists have argued about about the cause of the deaths . Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface until the the mass dying subsides. They are being taken to the city's main dump. The die-offs are common in Rio, where rivers, lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage. Rower and Olympic hopeful Felipe Xavier said: 'I have to come train but these dead fish bother us because the smell is very strong and the huge amount of fish slows the boat.' But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution. In February, twaite shad died  in the blighted waters of Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held. Members of a local rowing club have to train among the dead fish in Rodrigo de Freitas lake ahead of the Olympic Games in the city in 2016 .

The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature. 'The intense rains that happened last week and a rise in the sea levels led to a spike in the (sea) water entering the lake, causing a thermal shock,' it said in a statement, reporting that water temperature in the lake quickly fell by 4C. However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque?

Alexandre Fernandez (not pictured), rowing coach of Botafogo club, said he's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish. Rio's water quality has become one of the most contentious issues heading into the 2016 Olympics.

She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a   31million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received   315.4million and he also put   320million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian \u00e9migr\u00e9 parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top   31billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for   358million - more than   3700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for   355million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for   3130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a   3150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around   356million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple\u2019s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain\u2019s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth   3400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a   350million \u2018secret stash\u2019 hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a \u2018strong\u2019 case that her husband had access to \u2018very considerable resources\u2019, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: \u2018It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.\u2019 Mr Dellal\u2019s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal\u2019s wealth meant there was \u2018no prospect\u2019 of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an   38.5million mansion in Regent\u2019s Park, central London, a   33million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple\u2019s   35million home in Hampshire, a   31.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost   36million and has investments in the Middle East worth   326.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been \u2018somewhat diminished\u2019 recently, although Mr Dellal\u2019s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal\u2019s case without further scrutiny of her late husband\u2019s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard."

        "text": "A father and son were shot dead in an execution-style murder moments after party guests left their home in a quiet neighborhood. Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, an oil company manager, had been celebrating a victorious football game in their garage in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Wednesday. But moments after jovially waving goodbye to the last-remaining revelers shortly before midnight, they were both shot dead at close range in an attack that shocked and baffled the quiet community of Metairie. They were found by David's wife, Nicholas's mother, who had been in a bedroom when she heard gun shots. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Nicholas Pence, 25, (left) and his father David, 56, (right) were shot dead 'execution-style' at home on Wednesday night after a football party in their garage, or 'man cave'. Police believe it was a botched burglary . Tragic: They were found lifeless by Elizabeth Pence (center), mother to Nicholas (second left) and wife to David (right) moments after the shooting, which has left the quiet neighborhood of Metairie in mourning and shock . Charged: Police arrested Dexter Allen, 17, (left), and Haraqyon Degruy, 18, (right) in connection with the killings . On Sunday, police revealed 18-year-old Haraqyon Degruy and her friend Dexter Allen, 17, have been charged with the double killing. Neither have a 'significant' criminal history, officers revealed. The police investigation has failed to determine at link between the alleged assailants and their victims, or a motive. David Pence, a manager at a New Orleans branch of the international oil firm Baker Hughes Inc, was shot three times in the chest while sat in an armchair. Nicholas was shot in the face and back. He was found lying on the floor of their so-called 'man cave'. Elizabeth Pence dialed 911 to report the shooting, and the theft of her purse, iPod and iPhone. Friends of Nicholas, known to friends as Nick or 'Peezy', have set up a fundraising page to supplement funeral costs and support his surviving mother and sister. The family lived on Clifford Drive, a leafy part of Metairie, which is one of New Orleans' wealthier areas . Initial reports suggest it could have been a botched armed burglary, as Allen and Degruy were linked to earlier car break-ins. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said: 'Once again, this particular happenstance was completely, totally, shock-the-conscience type of homicide \u2014 obviously execution-style, very close.' Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.' Another friend said he was in the garage with Nicholas just minutes before the murder. Police believe 17-year-old Allen fired the fatal shots before running to the car and saying 'I just shot two people' to Degruy, who allegedly drove off, the New Orleans Advocate reported. Degruy has been charged with two counts of being an accessory  to first-degree murder and one count of vehicle burglary. Allen is being held on charges of fleeing police and two counts of first-degree murder. Weapon: Col John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office holds the heavy-duty gun which authorities believe was used to kill David, an oil company manager, and his son Nicholas after their party this week . A police report says the younger Pence had pointed out a suspicious white Toyota crawling through the street . Neighbor and friend Michael Soignet has described the agonizing moment Mrs Pence returned to the address, saying: 'She just gave me a strapping hug, and I choked up. She choked up. There were just no words.' Describing the victims to The New Orleans Advocate, she said: 'You'll never find anybody that's going to throw out a bad word on them, and if somebody does, they don't have their story right. 'This had to be a random act. It had to be.'"

        "text": "This eighteen-month-old boy pulled a rice-cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head, burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind. As a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity, Interplast, worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng, from Vientiane, Laos, inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt watched on. Turia was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big, brown eyes. That's because she knows that if she lived in a country like Seng's, she wouldn't be here. Foreign doctors wouldn't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011. 'I wouldn't have survived,' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on Thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods. 'If I was from Laos or Bangladesh, no ifs or buts, 100 per cent I would have died.' Scroll down for video . Stronger than ever and inspired by a little burned baby: Turia Pitt (pictured), who experienced burns to 64 per cent of her body during a September 2011 ultramarathon through the Kimberley, Western Australia . Burned by boiling water: Little baby Seng (left) is pictured being operated upon by surgeons in Laos (right) in a desperate attempt to save his sight. Turia Pitt witnessed the operation . Seng's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from Interplast. Turia told Daily Mail Australia Seng was 'for sure' one of her inspirations in working for Interplast . Fitter and stronger than ever: Turia Pitt's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational. She recently ran a half-marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 Kimberley blaze . Turia, who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames, believes Australians take their medical system for granted. Her remarkable recovery is a case-in-point. Few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the Kimberley ultra-marathon three-and-a-half-years ago. 'I'm fitter now than I was before!' Turia told Daily Mail Australia. Nervous about medical complications, Turia was 'dumbfounded' when she ran a half-marathon last month at a quicker pace (1hr 45mins) than her time before she was burned (1hr 50mins). The only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km, as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable. Powered by a fierce determination to prove herself, Turia Pitt is fitter than ever, embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. The six-day-a-week program features three major planks, working on the burns victim's already impressive cardio fitness, strength and flexibility. If it sounds daunting, never fear - even Turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes. 'All of us make excuses, don't we? I think it's a normal thing to do... I think it's part of being human.' THE PROGRAM . CARDIO : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week . STRENGTH: 2 personal training sessions per week, involving conditioning exercises including box-jumps and squats . FLEXIBILITY: 2 yoga sessions each week, 'just to get a good stretch' 'Maybe I've got something to prove... I think I am more motivated' Asked about what motivates her to keep so fit, she told Daily Mail Australia there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon. 'Maybe I've got something to prove.... I think I am more motivated,' she said, revealing her intense, six-day-a-week training regimen. She is hoping to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. 'Compared to what I've been through, things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison.' There were many dark moments during her recovery, she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but that of others. Turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but others as well . Her partner Michael Hoskin (left, pictured during a hike recently) has been Turia's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal . On Thursday, Turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved Seng's sight, Interplast. She will also provide an update on how Seng is progressing . 'There were terrible moments when I just wanted to give up,' she said. Not self-conscious: Turia Pitt has always taken pride in her appearance . Only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose, terrifying her partner, Michael Hoskin, and mother Celestine Vaite, who been by her side throughout the entire journey. 'I guess I was really blessed because I was surrounded by a really good support team, my partner (Michael), my family, my friends, the doctors, the nurses, even my local community of Ulladulla. 'In those really hard times I did draw strength from the people around me'. Given the nature of her work with Interplast, appearance was another topic Turia dwelled upon while talking to Daily Mail Australia. She said she has always taken pride in her appearance, which hasn't changed. The burns don't concern her - instead, they are something she is accustomed to. 'Let's say you're at a party and you're self conscious and you think your arse looks big,' Turia said. 'Every time someone looks at you, you going to think, \"they're thinking my arse looks big\". 'But if you aren't really thinking that at all, you won't see it. 'I'm not looking for people who are looking at me. 'But then, if I was really self-conscious, I'd probably notice it a lot more - because I'm sure there are people who do look at me.' Years after the disaster, life is something close to normal now for Turia, who lives life according to a simple creed. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' she said. 'And that's kind of what I've always done.' As for baby Seng, it is understood his big, brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as Turia. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' Turia Pitt told Daily Mail Australia. That is the simple creed by which she lives her life ."

Roberto Mancini has Liverpool midfielder Leiva and Barcelona's Song, currently on loan at West Ham, on his list of alternatives if Jovetic and Toure prove too costly. Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told Sky Italia: 'Dreams are beautiful, I'm trying to prepare something and I hope my dreams come true. Lucas Leiva (left) is believed to be a target for Inter Milan and could leave Liverpool in the summer . Alex Song has impressed during his loan spell at West Ham United and would be available for a transfer . 'Jovetic? In the past there was something, especially last summer. We had gone quite a bit forward in the negotiations, we were hoping to conclude the deal but then Negredo became injured and Manchester City changed their minds. 'He is a great player, he fits the profile of the player we are looking for. He is not very young but he is fully mature and still has a lot to give. He is a very talented player but the English club buys very often but seldom sells.' Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony. The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer, while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window. Roberto Mancini remains keen on the Manchester City duo he worked with while he was at the club . Yaya Toure (left) and Stevan Jovetic both look set to leave the club in the summer and Inter are keen . Toure, meanwhile, has been heavily linked with a move this summer and Mancini made his admiration known for the Ivorian earlier this month. Mancini said: 'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy. 'If, as it seems, he wants to have an experience in Italy, then there is this possibility he could come here. 'It won\u2019t be easy, but he\u2019s a player with incredible technique and character. Would Inter be his first choice? That\u2019s certain.'"

'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made.

Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than   350,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching   350,001 - ten times the initial target of   35,000. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork. Karen went missing from the Sanctuary nightclub not far from her home. Police initially searched a park in north-west Glasgow before switching their attention to a golf course and farm outside the city . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this text."

But it seems that some are setting their kids on the chosen path earlier than expected. Especially these mothers and fathers, who have projected their geeky interests onto their slumbering newborns in a series of adorable photographs. Art and photography community, BoredPanda have created a thread encouraging parents to showcase their 'true nerdy colours' by dressing their babies up as sci-fi characters, like Princess Leia from Star Wars . Another baby is dressed up as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache . One sleeping newborn is sporting a completely knitted Wonder Woman costume . Art, design and photography community BoredPanda has created a thread encouraging parents to upload cute images of their babies showcasing their parents' 'true nerdy colors.' And of course, obliging parents have taken to the thread with professional photography shots of their trussed up newborns. Dressed as characters ranging across fantasy and sci-fi movies, books, TV shows and comic books, the adorable babies are seen in different scenarios and positions that have clearly been carefully arranged by their parents. A few of the images have even been subject to careful doctoring via Photoshop, in order to make the scenarios more realistic. Spiderman's a popular choice! Another baby is pictured alongside toy replicas of his superhero comrades . These babies are dressed as Star Wars Jedi knights, complete with light sabers and the characteristic brown cloak . One baby has been incorporated into a complicated Harry Potter scenario, complete with round-framed glasses, suitcases for Hogwarts and a magic wand . Some parents have really taken the geek-factor to the next level and have dressed their babes as characters from sci-film films such as Star Wars. One baby is seen as Princess Leia, surrounded by cuddly toy versions of the characters, while she herself is laid comfortably in the middle, wrapped in lace swaddling and sporting a hilarious knitted version of the famous hair-buns. Another baby is dressed as a Jedi, wrapped in a brown cloak characteristic of the monastic characters with an illuminated lightsaber propped up next to him. One newborn is kitted out as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache. To complete the illusion, the baby has been gently laid on an old-school Nintendo gaming device. Two sleeping newborns have been dressed up as comic book characters. One as Flash (pictured left) and one as a Ninja Turtle (pictured right) Down the rabbit hole: One slumbering babe is in a sweet Alice - from Alice in Wonderland - costume, complete with a knitted pocket watch and a grinning Cheshire cat . Other babies have been dressed up like characters from well-known children books. One soundly-sleeping newborn has been incorporated into a scenario from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise. The baby sports the character's signature round-frame glasses, while laid on top of a pile of suitcases - possibly alluding to his journey to wizarding school, Hogwarts - and is surrounded by the world-famous books, as well as a makeshift wand. Another little-one is undoubtedly dressed as Alice from Lewis Caroll's much-loved, Alice in Wonderland. The sleeping baby sports a blue ribbon hairband and clutches a pocket watch as well as a toy replica of the grinning Cheshire cat. One of the images sees a baby dressed up as a Ninja Turtle, with a full knitted costume, even complete with pizza slice props, one of the characters' idiosyncracies . A newborn has been incorporated into a toy line-up of the much-loved recent Disney film, Frozen . Some parents have chosen to project their love of comic books on their babies, with some newborns kitted out as immediately recognisable superheroes, such as Flash, Wonder Woman, Spiderman, and Ninja Turtle. These costumes are complete with props such as string for Spiderman's webspray, inflatable swords in place of real ones, and even pizzas for the Ninja Turtles. One parent has decided to go with a recent much-loved Disney animation: Frozen. Their newborn is seen emulating Olaf, the enthusiastic snowman, photoshopped next to a line-up of toy versions of the other characters. Another soundly-sleeping babe is a medieval knight and is cushioned up on a toy horse, sporting fleecy-looking grey knitted 'armour' and 'helmet', while another newborn is simply a 'geek' with oversized glasses, a bow tie and a smart-phone.

        "text": "(CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to \"gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,\" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward \"other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,\" according to the commission. \"PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,\" commission President Michael Picker said. \"The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. \"Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,\" Tony Earley said. \"We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten.\" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

        "text": "A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video . Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Attack: Jamal al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died . Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran. Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department said 'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment\u2019s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa."

        "text": "Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'"

Robert Butler, 43, was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston. He was accompanied by his medical team. The operation took almost seven hours on Sunday and involved the Providence and Cranston fire departments, Lifespan, the Hospital Association of Rhode Island and Bay Crane Northeast. Scroll down for video . Robert Butler was transported inside a shipping container from Bannister House in Providence, Rhode Island to the Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston on Sunday after his nursing home shut down amid financial difficulties. In this 2009 image, he weighed 900lbs. He has since gained another 300lbs . The Rhode Island health department acquired a crane from Bay Crane Northeast to help with their operation . Mr Butler was moved to his new hospital resident in a shipping container alongside his medical team to monitor his health . According to Target 12, the complex operation began with firefighters widening the door of Butler's room, then building a special ramp to move Mr Butler on to a deck. He was then shifted into the shipping container, complete with medical equipment, and lifted with a crane down on to a flatbed truck. Michael Raia of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health & Human Services said planning for the move began weeks ago. Mr Raia said the new facility is better equipped to help Butler. In 2006, Mr Butler, who is on permanent disability, told local news channels that his bed was broken  at the nursing home and he was not receiving proper care. At the time, he weighed 900lbs and was trying to find a doctor to perform a gastric bypass and a way to cover the cost of the medical bills. He told WPRI that his weight problem was linked to his depression and that he was addicted to food. The crane was used to hoist Mr Butler in a medically-equipped shipping container from the nursing home on to a flatbed truck on Sunday afternoon . Mr Butler weighs around 1,200lb after a decade of battling his weight which he linked to depression . Mr Butler said in an interview in 2006 (pictured) that he was desperate for a gastric bypass but was unable to find a doctor to perform the surgery. At the time he weight 900lb ."

        "text": "Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February .

        "text": "(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama \"L.A. Law,\" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"That Championship Season,\" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed \"L.A. Law\" \u2014 created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher \u2014 aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. \"I always had him in mind for that role,\" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. \"He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect.\" \"We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,\" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. \"Sometimes I worry \u2014 it's all been going too well \u2014 a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!\" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm \"Day One\" and in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance,\" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm \"Truman,\" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in \"Meteor\" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing \"The Hospital\" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in \"Being There\" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and a physician in such films as \"The Terminal Man\" (1974), \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" (1985) and \"Warning Sign\" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm \"Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair\" and in Mario Van Peebles' \"Panther\" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's \"Petulia\" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in \"Pale Rider\" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\" (1987); and sold barbwire in \"Back to the Future III\" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in \"All in Good Time,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Place Without Doors.\" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in \"That Championship Season.\" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including \"The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder\" (1974), \"The Day of the Locust\" (1975), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1978), \"Prophecy\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985) and \"Hard Rain\" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\" (1974), \"The People vs. Jean Harris\" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in \"The Last Days of Patton\" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in \"Malice in Wonderland\" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the \"L.A. Law\" reunion telefilm of 2002. \"They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,\" he said of watching \"L.A. Law\" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. \"[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know.\" People we've lost in 2015 .   92015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved."
